## Hi, I'm Mathias

Data Engineer building production-ready data platforms and reusable ETL/ELT templates (Bronze/Silver/Gold), with an automation-first mindset.

**What I build**
- End-to-end ETL/ELT pipelines and orchestration
- Lakehouse-style architectures (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- Analytics-ready models and reusable project templates
- Production practices: modular code, IaC, config-driven, security by design

**Core stack**
Python · SQL · AWS (S3, Glue, Athena, Step Functions) · dbt · Docker · Git

**How to navigate**
- Public repos: reusable patterns/templates you can adapt
- Projects are anonymized from real production systems
- Private repos: client-specific implementations
